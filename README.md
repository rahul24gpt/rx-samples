### Just Build the project and start learning RxJava by examples.

### Using RxJava 2.0 Library in your application

Add this in your build.gradle
```groovy
compile 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.2.2'
```
If you are using RxAndroid also, then add the following
```groovy
compile 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.1.0'
```

# RxJava 2 Examples present in this sample project

* RxJava 2.0 Example using `CompositeDisposable` as `CompositeSubscription` and `Subscription` have
been removed.

* RxJava 2 Example using `Flowable`.

* RxJava 2 Example using `SingleObserver`, `CompletableObserver`.

* RxJava 2 Example using RxJava2 operators such as `map, zip, take, reduce, flatMap, filter, buffer, skip, merge, concat, replay`, and much more:

* RxJava 2 Android Samples using `Function` as `Func1` has been removed.

* RxJava 2 Android Samples  using `BiFunction` as `Func2` has been removed.

* And many others android examples

# Operators :
* `Map` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item
* `Zip` -> combine the emissions of multiple Observables together via a specified function and emit single items for each combination based on the results of this function
* `Filter` -> emit only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test
* `FlatMap` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, then flatten the emissions from those into a single Observable
* `Take` -> emit only the first n items emitted by an Observable
* `Reduce` -> apply a function to each item emitted by an Observable, sequentially, and emit the final value
* `Skip` -> suppress the first n items emitted by an Observable
* `Buffer` -> periodically gather items emitted by an Observable into bundles and emit these bundles rather than emitting the items one at a time
* `Concat` -> emit the emissions from two or more Observables without interleaving them
* `Replay` -> ensure that all observers see the same sequence of emitted items, even if they subscribe after the Observable has begun emitting items
* `Merge` -> combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions
* `SwitchMap` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, and mirror those items emitted by the most-recently transformed Observable
